===1. Activate the Google !BigQuery Service===
See [ActivatingBigQueryService Activate Google BigQuery] for details.

Existing !BigQuery users may skip the section 'Sign up for !BigQuery Service' in the above link. But they are advised to refer to the section 'Generate API Access ID' for instructions on the properties needed for establishing a Jaspersoft-!BigQuery Datasource connection.

===2. Download Jaspersoft !BigQuery connector===
Download the following files from the [http://code.google.com/p/jaspersoft-bigquery-datasource/downloads/list downloads section]:

  * Jaspersoft-iReport-!BigQueryPlugin-0.0.4.nbm
  * jrs-bigquery-0.0.4.zip

Download the [http://www.jaspersoft.com/thanks-download-30-day Jaspersoft Business Intelligence Suite]. This includes both !JasperReports Server and iReport.

===3. Install the Jaspersoft !BigQuery Plugin for iReport===
By default iReport can connect to relational databases via JDBC. It can connect to XML, JSON, XLS, Hadoop Hive, MongoDB, and many other sources. But it cannot connect to Google !BigQuery. (Not yet!) But adding support for !BigQuery takes only a few seconds.<br>
