That should be enough to get started. Refer to the [https://developers.google.com/bigquery/docs/getting-started official sign up documentation] for comprehensive details.

===2. Generating API Access ID===
Google APIs use the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication and authorization. There are many possible scenarios for using OAuth including Login, Web Server Applications, Client-side Applications, Installed Applications, Devices, and Service Accounts. Refer to the [https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2 official OAuth2 documentation] for complete details.

The Jaspersoft-!BigQuery connector uses the *Service Account* scenario. Therefore you must obtain a Client ID and a private key. The connector uses this information to authenticate with !BigQuery. The steps are the following:

  # Navigate to the API Access on the left-hand sidebar in the Google APIs Console.
  # Create an OAuth Client ID.
  # Download the private key.
  # You need the following to use these credentials:
    * Private key
    * Email address
    * Project ID
